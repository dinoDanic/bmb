# Code Style

- TypeScript + React (`.ts`, `.tsx`), prefer functional components.
- File naming follows kebab-case in `components/` (e.g., `component-example.tsx`).
- Indentation: 2 spaces (follow existing files).
- Linting with ESLint; no Prettier config is present.
- Tailwind CSS v4 is configured via `postcss.config.mjs`; keep utility classes readable and grouped.
